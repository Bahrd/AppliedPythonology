r'''
  If e size of the block, B ≠ 8, then the standard scalar quantization is applied 
  and then 'Q == 1' means no scalar quantization (other than conversion to the 'int' type)
  is performed.
  
  For B == 8 the JP[E]G quantization matrix is applied (for 'Y' channel).
  Then 'Q == 0.1' results (usually) in a poor quality image while
  'Q == 10' yields a (seemingly) indistinguishable image.
  When 'B != 8', then the scalar quantization, 'x = Q⁻¹⌊Q⋅x + .5⌋', is performed
