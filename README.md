## System identification and image processing algorithms
### Low-level image processing
- basic interpolation algorithm: '[interpolation.py](https://github.com/Bahrd/AppliedPythonology/blob/master/interpolation.py)'
- basic demosaicking algorithms: 
- Julia and Mandelbrot fractals visualisations:
### Modeling and identification
- basic pseudo-random number generator:
- basic function regression estimation with L1 constraints
### Todo(s)
- [ ] other simple image processing algorithms 
	- [ ] orthogonal series approximations
	- [ ] JPG/H.264/5-like compression schemes
- [ ] other system identification algorithms
	- dedicated algorithms for Wiener and Hammerstein systems
	- Volterra and Wiener series based algorithms for more general structures (LNL, NLN, etc.)
